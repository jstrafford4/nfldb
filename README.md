# Look for dfs folder

The "dfs" folder contains all my code.  Nfldb has its own readme, it just served as a medium for getting me something to bang on while my ideas of machine learning have matured.  Almost all I have is PG/SQL functions for computing fantasy points, correlation, variance, and as I progressed toward making my own projections, I wrote down a few ideas for a rudimentary but generalized feature structure.

I have no idea which features would turn out to be most predictive, a 5 week maximum rush yards, a 4 week median vegas implied total, I don't know.

But by the time I had enough data to try any projections for this year, I had already realized how advanced the DFS industry has gotten in the past couple years.  The companies selling their projections have access to much more meaningful statistics such as targets and air yards. I would never be in a position to reliably bet my money against the pros.

I enjoyed every second of the code I wrote, on grayhounds, coffee shops in my hometown, weekends with the roommates out of town, just sketching out how to calculate and update player correlations based on data for each individual play.  But most likely this code has served all the purpose it will.

Perhaps a freshly motivated future me will come back to it for inspiration, as I tackle the problem with access to newer and more predictive features.
