# Look for dfs folder

The "dfs" folder contains all my code.  Nfldb has its own readme, it just served as a medium for getting me something to bang on while my ideas of machine learning have matured.  Almost all I have is PG/SQL functions for computing fantasy points, correlation, variance, and as I progressed toward making my own projections, I wrote down a few ideas for a rudimentary but generalized feature structure.

I have no idea which features would turn out to be most predictive, a 5 week maximum rush yards, a 4 week median vegas implied total, I don't know.

But by the time I had enough data to try any projections for this year, I had already realized how advanced the DFS industry has gotten in the past couple years.  The professional players and companies selling their proprietary projections have access to more meaningful statistics, such as total air yards for passes thrown to receivers. I don't even have targets.  I wouldn't be in a position to reliably bet my projections against theirs, and I took a break from the project while I gathered my ideas.

I enjoyed every second of the code I wrote but most likely this code has served its purpose.  Perhaps a freshly motivated future me will come back to for inspiration, as I tackle the problem with access to newer and more predictive features.

In that case, this last sentence is for you, future me.  Don't do it unless you have a fresh competitive angle, something awesome like quantifying text data by reporters and searching for correlation with point totals.  Even then, pick a different sport, not the sport with the shortest season and extremely high variance.
